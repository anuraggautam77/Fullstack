# Setup
1. Start by forking and cloning this repository into your account.
1. Add your `09-react-redux` repository as a remote with the command: `git remote add 09-react-redux <insert-09-react-redux-repository-url-here>`
1. `git remote -v` should display origin and 06-scalable-auth-with-docker
1. Pull your `09-react-redux` changes into the master branch with the command: `git pull 09-react-redux master`. Now there will be merge conflict in README.md file.
1. Update the `README.md` file to these instructions, and remove the instructions from `09-react-redux`.
1. Commit the changes. You are now ready to start working on this programming task.

# Submission
1. After completing the exercise/assignment, create a git tag by typing the command `git tag submission`
2. Push your tag to the server by typing the command `git push origin submission`
